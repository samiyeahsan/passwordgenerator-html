# This is java scrip to generate password
I did create varibale for charactors that can be choose for each password.

## User functions

.There are some propmt that will ask user some qustion about lenght of the password and what character user wants to have in this password.
.There is an alert that will tell user to password lenght should be between 8 charactor to 128.
.I have 4 different varibale ( number, special, upper, lower).
.every time user says yes to adding character it will add the value to an aarray and at the end it can create the final password. 

### The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
